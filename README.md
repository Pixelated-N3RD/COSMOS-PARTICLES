# COSMOS-PARTICLES
# Gesture + Touch Controlled Particle System

A real-time WebGL particle simulation with hand-tracking and touch gestures using Three.js and MediaPipe Hands. A Three.js-based 3D particle experience implemented in a single HTML file. 
 
A 3D interactive particle experience using:
- Three.js
- MediaPipe Hands
- Touch & Gesture controls

## Features
- Hand pinch to zoom
- Fist to freeze rotation (just like holding a ball infront of the camera)
- hold your hand to left for left roation and vice-versa. same for up and down rotation.
- Touch pinch zoom
- Gesture-based interaction
- I will be adding more shapes in future. Till then good luck.
